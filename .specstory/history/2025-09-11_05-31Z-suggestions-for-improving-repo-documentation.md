# Suggestions for improving repo documentation (2025-09-11 05:31Z)

_**User (2025-09-11 02:20Z)**_

What suggestions do you have to improve this repo documentation?

I would love to see a an OpenAPI spec generated from the code, present within each repo that has an external domain API.

Another interesting thing is to add sequence diagrams with business rules highlights for some of the repo's usecases.

Extend the set of ideas and then later on ask me which options to actually implement.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning documentation improvements**

I need to respond to the user's request for suggestions on improving repository documentation, especially regarding OpenAPI specification generation and sequence diagrams. They want a thorough set of ideas, so it’s more about planning than making immediate code edits. The tool specifications allow us to skip to-do lists for read-only suggestions, but I must remember to provide status updates and a summary. I can proceed with suggestions without creating to-dos.
**Providing documentation suggestions**

The user is looking for a set of concise suggestions organized into categories like API documentation, architecture diagrams, and more. I should list items such as Dev onboarding, testing, observability, security, and API usage, among others. It’s important to include practical details like commands to generate OpenAPI from Spring Boot using specific plugins, and the tools for generating AsyncAPI for Kafka. I’ll also touch on sequence diagrams and business rules, like using decision tables. This should be thorough yet structured!
**Detailing additional documentation**

I should include architecture decision records using tools like adr-tools. It’s also important to add CODEOWNERS and CONTRIBUTING.md files, along with PR and issue templates. For a multi-module Java Maven project, I’ll mention a version matrix and a diagram of module relationships. I need to provide instructions on running e2e tests, a standardized Makefile, a maintainers' guide, and an operational runbook, plus document environment variables per 12-factor guidelines. I’ll also cover health endpoints and conventional commit guidance, along with a "docs/diagrams" directory and CI documentation checks. Plus, I’ll consider outlining the architecture using Structurizr Lite or PlantUML for C4 models.
**Enhancing documentation further**

I need to add an observability document covering metrics and logs, including a sample Grafana dashboard and a dedicated dashboard directory. I’ll also create separate documents for release and versioning, a security threat model using STRIDE lite, a glossary, an FAQ, benchmarks, a performance test document, and an upgrade guide. Although I can't add a new license, I can suggest verifying its presence. Additionally, I’ll include a changelog, CI badges for the README, and details on publishing OpenAPI as a static site. For the loan-api module, I’ll note the existing OpenAPI spec, propose using springdoc-openapi for auto-generation at build time, and suggest Maven plugin configurations, along with hosting swagger-ui at /swagger-ui.
**Proposing documentation enhancements**

I propose verifying the API spec in CI and using AsyncAPI for Kafka topics with tools like `asyncapi-generator` or springwolf. For sequence diagrams, I’ll document typical flows like loan applications and approvals, using Mermaid for GitHub compatibility, and potentially automate generation from logs. I'll outline business rules with decision tables and propose making the docs discoverable through a comprehensive README and a dedicated site using tools like mkdocs or Docusaurus. I’ll include details on automated documentation processes and outline specific improvements per module, seeking to identify which enhancements the user wants to implement first.</details></think>

I’ll outline concrete documentation improvements across areas (API, architecture, ops, dev), then you can pick what to implement first.

### API and Events
- **OpenAPI from code (loan-api)**: Use `springdoc-openapi` to generate spec at build time, publish to `loan-api/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml` and serve Swagger UI. Add CI check to fail on drift. Note: you already have `openapi.yaml`—switch to generation to keep it source-of-truth.
- **AsyncAPI for events (Kafka)**: Document topics, payloads, headers, and versioning across `loan-api` and `loan-notification-service`. Generate from annotations (e.g., Springwolf) or maintain in `loan-events` as schemas.
- **JSON Schema for events**: Co-locate in `loan-events` and validate in tests; add compatibility policy (backward-compatible changes).
- **API usage examples**: `curl`/HTTPie snippets and common flows; include error codes and problem+json format.

### Architecture and Domain
- **Sequence diagrams (Mermaid)**: Flows like “Apply → Persist → Outbox → Kafka → Notification.” Highlight business rules at each step. Store in `docs/diagrams/` and render in-module READMEs.
- **C4 diagrams (Structurizr or C4-PlantUML)**: Context, Container, and Component views for the three modules.
- **Domain glossary and ubiquitous language**: Define loan terms, statuses, scoring, events, and invariants.
- **Business rules**: Decision tables for eligibility, limits, and status transitions; reference rule sources and edge cases.

### Developer Onboarding
- **Top-level README overhaul**: Clear “What is this?”, architecture map, quick start, commands, module map, and links to deeper docs.
- **Per-module READMEs**: `loan-api`, `loan-notification-service`, `loan-events`, `e2e-tests` each get purpose, how to run, APIs/events, and troubleshooting.
- **Makefile targets**: `make setup`, `make run`, `make test`, `make e2e`, `make docs`. Document these in README.
- **.env.example**: List required env vars with descriptions (no values), link to 12-factor guidance.
- **Contribution guide**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` with Conventional Commits + gitmoji, branch strategy, code style, pre-commit hooks, and PR checklist.
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)**: `docs/adr/` index, decisions on outbox, Kafka, module split, and test strategy.

### Testing and Quality
- **Test strategy doc**: Unit vs integration vs e2e, where tests live, how to run locally and in CI, data management.
- **Contract tests**: Producer/consumer (Pact or Spring Cloud Contract) across `loan-api` and notification service; document flow and CI wiring.
- **Coverage reporting**: JaCoCo reports and a badge in README; define thresholds.
- **API spec verification in tests**: Validate OpenAPI/AsyncAPI against runtime responses/messages in CI.

### Ops, Reliability, and Observability
- **Runbook**: Start/stop, readiness, migrations, how to replay outbox, failure modes, and recovery steps.
- **Health and readiness**: Document `/healthz`, readiness probes, and what they check.
- **Metrics and logs**: What’s emitted (names, labels), sample queries/dashboards; link to `dashboards/` and a screenshot.
- **Tracing**: Document key spans and attributes; trace-based sequence diagram generation as a future enhancement.
- **SLOs and alerts (lightweight)**: Define basic SLIs and alert ideas (e.g., outbox lag, consumer lag).

### Data and Persistence
- **DB schema and ER diagram**: Generated from JPA or via SchemaSpy; checked into `docs/db/` with how-to-regenerate.
- **Migration policy**: Document Flyway naming, idempotency, and release-time migration steps.

### Release and Governance
- **Changelog**: `CHANGELOG.md` managed via Conventional Commits; automate from tags.
- **Versioning policy**: Modules and event schemas; compatibility guarantees.
- **Security notes**: Dependency update cadence, scanning, and secrets handling.

### Documentation System and Automation
- **Docs site**: `docs/` with MkDocs or Docusaurus; build in CI and publish to GitHub Pages. Version via `mike` (optional).
- **Diagrams-as-code pipeline**: PlantUML/Mermaid render in CI and store PNGs/SVGs. Fail on broken links (link checker).
- **Doc drift checks**: CI step to confirm OpenAPI/AsyncAPI and ER diagram are up to date.

### Module-specific suggestions (quick wins)
- **loan-api**: Generate OpenAPI + Swagger UI; document endpoints, errors, and examples; add component diagram.
- **loan-notification-service**: AsyncAPI for consumed/produced topics; consumer lag metrics and retry/backoff docs.
- **loan-events**: Source of truth for event models, JSON Schemas, versioning and compatibility guide.
- **e2e-tests**: How to run, what’s covered, environment requirements; include a sequence diagram for the full lifecycle test.

Would you like me to implement a first batch? Suggested starter set:
- Generate OpenAPI in `loan-api` with CI drift check and Swagger UI.
- Add AsyncAPI skeletons for topics in `loan-events` with validation in CI.
- Create `docs/diagrams/` with 2 Mermaid sequence diagrams for core flows.
- Add per-module READMEs and `.env.example`.
- Add `Makefile` and README quick-start with standardized commands.

Pick the items you want in the first PR, and I’ll implement them end-to-end.

Dump these options to a "/.research" folder, a file named TODO_DOCUMENTATION_GAPS.md

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating documentation file**

I need to create a file named `TODO_DOCUMENTATION_GAPS.md` in the `.research` directory at the repo root, based on the user's request to "Dump these options." If the directory doesn't exist, I'll create it and then add the file with content covering the improvements. I'll follow the tools specs for this codebase change, noting it's a simple, single-file creation. Content formatting will need to use headings as specified in the Markdown guidelines.
**Creating structured documentation**

I’m going to create a structured document with sections based on our previous suggestions, covering categories like API and Events, Architecture, Developer Onboarding, Testing, and more. I’ll add checkboxes for planning tasks and specific actionable steps for each module, using backticks for file paths. Although the repo guidelines say to place non-code artifacts in `.specstory`, the user requested to dump it into `/.research`. Following the user's instructions, I'll create the folder and file accordingly.
**Applying patch and updating status**

I need to use the `apply_patch` syntax, which requires the file path and patch content. I must also include a status update, following the status update spec with a brief 1-2 sentence summary before the tool calls. At the end, I’ll summarize the changes made. While I won't output the code directly, I'll create the file and may display a short excerpt using the `citing_code` method, showing line numbers and the file path as needed. I'll summarize that I created the file with the intended content.
**Drafting documentation content**

While it might be helpful to include a short code block, it’s optional, and I can keep it concise if needed. When quoting, I'll provide line numbers, paths, and code content, but I might skip that to maintain clarity. I need to use absolute paths as tool call arguments for the `apply_patch`, so I’ll use the absolute path for our file. For the content draft, I’ll start with the title and a brief intro about the repo, then outline sections like API and Events, mentioning relevant steps.
**Preparing documentation tasks**

I’ll organize tasks into a bullet list instead of including code. The tasks will cover various categories such as AsyncAPI for events, architecture diagrams, developer onboarding, and more, each with specific actionable items and checkboxes. I’ll ensure to use the preferred "###" headings and backticks for file paths while avoiding bare URLs. At the top, I’ll add a note on how to use this file as a backlog. After creating the file with `apply_patch`, I’ll conclude with a summary of the added content. Time to implement!</details></think>

I'll add a new `.research/TODO_DOCUMENTATION_GAPS.md` file containing the outlined documentation improvement options, organized by category with checklists and module-specific quick wins.
