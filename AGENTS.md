# Repository Guidelines

## Project Context
- Loan lifecycle demo built with Spring Boot microservices (`loan-api`, `loan-notification-service`, `loan-events`) plus observability stack and TS e2e tests.
- Root `README.md` captures system overview, workflows, and links into module docs.
- Detailed documentation lives alongside code:
  - `loan-api/README.md`
  - `loan-notification-service/README.md`
  - `loan-events/README.md`
  - `docker/README.md`
  - `e2e-tests/README.md`
  - `dashboards/README.md`
  - `manual-tests/README.md`
  - `docs/` (architecture, events, operations)

## Agent Quick Checklist
1. Read the relevant README for the module/folder you will modify.
2. Confirm tooling is installed (Java 17+, Maven, Docker, Node 18+) and run targeted tests before/after changes.
3. Update documentation/tests alongside code updates; prefer colocated README edits over root-only notes.
4. Follow Conventional Commit + gitmoji format (see below) and use repo-local git identity.
5. Respect existing changes‚Äînever revert user edits unless explicitly requested.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` ‚Äì service code (domain, API, adapters).
- `tests/` ‚Äì unit/integration tests mirror `src/` paths.
- `manual-tests/` ‚Äì HTTP request collections for manual verification.
- `infra/` ‚Äì IaC/compose files if used.
- `.specstory/` ‚Äì working notes/history currently in this repo; keep non-code artifacts here.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use what matches the toolchain present in the repo:
- Python: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`, `pip install -e .[dev]`, `pytest -q`.
- Node/TS: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm run build`, `pnpm test --silent`, `pnpm run dev`.
- Make (if `Makefile` exists): `make setup`, `make test`, `make run`.
Prefer adding thin `make` targets to standardize local workflows.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Languages: prefer TypeScript or Python for new modules.
- Style: Python uses Black (88 cols) + isort + Ruff; TS uses ESLint (typescript-eslint) + Prettier.
- Naming: directories and files `kebab-case` (TS) or `snake_case` (Py); classes `PascalCase`; functions/vars `camelCase` (TS) or `snake_case` (Py).
- Keep modules small; one responsibility per file.

## Testing Guidelines
- Frameworks: `pytest` for Python, `jest`/`vitest` for TS.
- Structure: tests mirror `src/` with `test_*.py` or `*.spec.ts`.
- Coverage: target ‚â• 80%; add regression tests for fixed bugs.
- Run: `pytest -q` or `pnpm test`; add `:watch` scripts for fast feedback.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add loan scoring rules`).
- Scope small, message body explains why and how; reference issues (`Closes #123`).
- PRs: clear description, screenshots or logs when UX/CLI changes, checklist of impacts (tests, docs, config). Ensure CI green and no lint errors.

### Commit Format with Gitmoji
- Use Conventional Commits + gitmoji prefix. Examples:
  - `‚ú® feat(api): add loan simulation endpoint`
  - `üêõ fix(outbox): handle advisory lock contention`
  - `üß™ test(e2e): full lifecycle with Testcontainers`
  - `üìù docs: add OpenAPI spec and README sections`
  - `üèóÔ∏è build(ci): add Maven + PITest workflow`
- Keep subject ‚â§72 chars; body explains rationale and impacts.

### Git Identity
- Use this repo-local identity for commits:
  - `git config user.name "Tassio Abreu (Codex Agent)"`
  - `git config user.email "tazabreu@gmail.com"`

## 12-Factor App Guidelines
- Config via env vars: no secrets in repo. Ship `.env.example` (no values). Read `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`; use `dotenv` only in dev.
- Dependencies declared/isolated: Python uses `pyproject.toml` + lock (e.g., pip-tools/uv); Node uses `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Install with `pip install -e .[prod]` or `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- Backing services as attached resources: treat DB/cache/queue as URLs; swap via env without code changes.
- Stateless processes: no local disk writes (except ephemeral `/tmp`). Persist to DB/object storage; scale via process concurrency.
- Port binding: web services listen on `PORT` and self-advertise readiness in logs.
- Logs as event streams: write structured (JSON) logs to stdout/stderr; do not write log files.
- Disposability: fast start/stop; handle `SIGTERM` gracefully; expose Actuator health probes (e.g., `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/health/readiness`).
- Dev/prod parity & releases: one Dockerfile; `make build` produces the same artifact locally/CI. Separate build/release/run; run migrations in release (`make migrate`/`pnpm run migrate`).

## Agent-Specific Instructions
- Stay within this repo‚Äôs scope; follow these conventions for any files you touch.
- Prefer minimal, focused changes; update docs/tests alongside code.
- Do not add licenses or new tooling without request. Use `rg` for search and `apply_patch` for edits.
- When new docs are created, cross-link them from the relevant module README and this file.
