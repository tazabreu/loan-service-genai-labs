<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Preparing e2e Tests**

I need to run e2e tests for a Maven multi-module Java project, which includes tests in both e2e/ (Node TypeScript) and e2e-tests/ (Java Maven). The user asked me to not only run these tests but also explain it to Miguel as if he were 5. 

First, I’ll check if there’s a Makefile since it’s untracked in Git. Also, I can run `npm ci` in e2e/. For the Maven project, I can use the command `mvn -q -pl e2e-tests -am -D... verify` or similar.
**Setting Up e2e Tests**

I might need to spin up services like the loan-api and loan-notification-service. It looks like there’s a docker/docker-compose.yml that may include these services, along with a database and Kafka. To run the e2e tests, I’ll likely need to execute `docker-compose up` first.

I should check files like docker-compose.yml, e2e/package.json, e2e-tests/pom.xml, and the root pom.xml. It might also be helpful to refer to the README instructions. I’ll create a to-do list to manage multi-step tasks: build modules, start infrastructure, run e2e tests, and collect results while providing status updates.
**Reading Necessary Files**

I need to open several files for our project</details></think>
