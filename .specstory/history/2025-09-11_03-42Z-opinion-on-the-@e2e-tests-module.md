What is your opinion on the module @e2e-tests/ ?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Gathering e2e-tests insights**

I need to respond to the user's opinion request about the module @e2e-tests/ and look into its folder and relevant files. I'll start by reading the e2e-tests folder’s pom.xml and the FullLifecycleIT.java test class to form my assessment. Additionally, it makes sense to check the repo root pom.xml to see how everything fits together, including module names and integration. My aim is to provide a structured, concise overview without adding any action items.
**Preparing file reads**

I’m planning to run a parallel read for four files, specifically the e2e-tests pom.xml, the FullLifecycleIT.java test file, the main pom.xml, and the loan-api pom.xml. I’m considering whether to check the docker-compose for integration or if it's unnecessary. I might also explore if e2e-tests use testcontainers or rest-assured. Before making the tool calls, I’ll include a status update and aim to present concise opinions organized with bullet points and appropriate markdown headings.</details></think>

I'll take a quick look at the `e2e-tests` module's `pom.xml` and main test to give a concrete, focused opinion, and also check how it's wired into the root build.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing e2e-tests module**

I'm analyzing the e2e-tests module where we need to provide an opinion. The developer spec asks for status updates and to use tools in parallel. We initially used the read_file tool in sequence and included a brief update. According to the guidelines, we should have incorporated a micro-update before tool calls. We didn't use parallelization, which I now recognize was necessary. Now, it's time to formulate my opinion on that compliance aspect.
**Evaluating e2e-tests module**

I'm reviewing the e2e-tests module, which utilizes Testcontainers for Postgres and Redpanda while bootstrapping services with SpringApplicationBuilder. The pros include realistic end-to-end testing that covers HTTP, DB, Kafka, and inter-service interactions, independent of external infrastructure. However, there are some cons: it employs a raw Kafka client with manual string parsing, tests might be flaky due to hard-coded ports, and it lacks Docker Compose or reusability. Additionally, potential classpath sharing and missing configurations for parallelization are concerns.
**Suggesting improvements for e2e-tests**

I can suggest some improvements for the e2e-tests module. Instead of using a GenericContainer, it might be better to utilize the Testcontainers Redpanda module or the Confluent KafkaContainer. It's best to avoid binding to a fixed host port and instead use network aliases with container networking. There’s a possibility of switching to Testcontainers' RedpandaContainer, as they do currently support it. Using a KafkaContainer that sets up proper listeners would also help. Additionally, I can recommend using reusable containers in Testcontainers while keeping Ryuk disabled.
**Identifying further improvements**

I’m looking at improvements for the e2e-tests modules. One option could be to use Spring’s TestRestTemplate or WebTestClient. Although the RestClient is currently fine since we're spinning up the server with arbitrary ports. The POM dependencies for e2e-tests include both loan-api and loan-notification-service, and they’re booted programmatically, which could lead to conflicts due to them being in the same classpath. Using SpringBootTest to run them as separate processes might help ensure better isolation. They do have some good configurations like using Flyway and PostgresContainer, but some properties might still be missing.
**Reviewing the e2e-tests Module**

I’ve evaluated the e2e-tests module's POM and test setup, finding it generally solid but with some areas for improvement. They didn't set `spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding`, which is fine, and although they use Awaitility, it’s not in the tests. Using Jackson for JSON parsing instead of manual string manipulation would streamline things. 

### Overall
This module offers good separation with Failsafe integration and realistic full lifecycle testing across Kafka.

### Strengths
- In-process service booting and isolated infrastructure.
- Deterministic DB via containers and random port assignments.

### Risks/Cons
- Fixed host port binding and custom commands could lead to flakiness.
- Lacks integration hints for CI and parallel test safety.

### Suggestions
- Switch to KafkaContainer or RedpandaContainer.
- Avoid hard-coded ports, use Jackson for parsing, and implement Awaitility for timeouts.

I reviewed the POMs and tests; there are no blockers. Overall, it’s a pragmatic e2e suite, with minor enhancements suggested.</details></think>

I reviewed the `e2e-tests` module’s `pom.xml`, the `FullLifecycleIT` test, and the root `pom.xml`. Here’s a concise assessment.

### Overall
- **Verdict**: Solid, pragmatic E2E module that exercises the full flow (API → DB → Kafka → notification service) with Testcontainers. Good isolation and realistic checks.

### What’s good
- **Full-lifecycle coverage**: Boots `loan-api` and `loan-notification-service` and validates emitted Kafka events end-to-end.
- **Testcontainers usage**: PostgreSQL and Redpanda are containerized; DB is wired via container JDBC URL.
- **Maven wiring**: Uses Failsafe with `**/*IT.java`; included as a module in the root `pom.xml`.
- **Random server ports**: Avoids clashes for HTTP listeners.

### Risks / rough edges
- **Fixed host port for Kafka (29092)**: Using `GenericContainer` with a bound host port can be flaky on shared CI or if the port is in use.
- **GenericContainer for Redpanda**: Manual command/advertised listeners; easier to misconfigure and more brittle than a purpose-built container class.
- **Manual JSON parsing**: `extractId` string slicing is fragile; better to parse JSON properly.
- **Polling loop for Kafka**: Works, but readability and determinism would benefit from Awaitility-based “eventually” assertions.
- **Same JVM for both services**: Convenient, but classpath/config cross-talk is possible; make sure properties are fully isolated.

### Quick, high-impact improvements
- **Use KafkaContainer (with Redpanda image) and avoid fixed host ports**:
  - Replace `GenericContainer` with `KafkaContainer(DockerImageName.parse("redpandadata/redpanda:..."))` (or standard Kafka image).
  - Use `getBootstrapServers()` and remove host port binding logic.
- **Parse JSON with Jackson**:
  - Replace `extractId` with `ObjectMapper.readTree(body).get("id").asText()`.
- **Switch to Awaitility for Kafka consumption**:
  - Await until the expected number of messages for the `loanId` arrives, with reasonable timeouts.
- **Gate in CI with a profile**:
  - Consider a `-Pe2e` profile to control when Failsafe runs, and document the command in `README.md`.

Summary:
- Strong foundation that meaningfully validates the system E2E. Make Kafka containerization more robust (no fixed ports), parse JSON safely, and use Awaitility to reduce flakiness.
